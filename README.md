# Exploring covariance between predicted strength and canonical (predictor) properties

- data_import.py: uses openKimInterface.py to extract property data from OpenKIM
- explore.py: populate pairplot figures, covariance heatmap and correlation matrix
- model_selection.py: explore combinations of factors for model (LOOCV and RepeatedKFold CV)
- uncertainty_quantification.py: perform bootstrap uncert quantification on model
